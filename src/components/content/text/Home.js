        This site was started in 2017 as a simple project to try few things with  Reac.
        Then it was something like a portfolio, it's nice to show that you actually 
        able to do something and it works. And it did serve well for that purpose
        I have got a job, only as a backend developer ).

        Recently got my hands freed from my permanent job. Got free time and I decided to
        make something new from this website. Probably it will become a personal web site
        of developer? Currently web site is under heavy costruction and if you have
        some ideas of what I could put on this site, how to orginize things, how to improve
        what is already done, plese contact me by e-mail.

        Plans for this website. Usually I scarcely have time for work on this project.
        I may slow things down a bit and will try to make this site more like a programmer blog.
        It takes time to write good content so I expect progress on this site will be
        rather ubrupt and hectic. For example, work on Todo App is postponed until better times.
        Things are comlicated even more since I started write code with Rust.
