            My name is Viacheslav and I’m a programmer. I have layed my hands on the
            keyboard something around 1988. Since then I have wrote code on such
            programming languages as: PHP, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript,
            Dart, Python, Golang, Rust and a little bit of C. And of course use HTML
            and CSS for a web development. I have enjoyed developing web, desktop,
            CLI and mobile applications, some of these I enjoy developing more than others.

            Why have I try so many things?
            Out of curiosity and presence of time, I guess. Once man tested things he
            will find his preferences and I have found mines. By my opinion programmer
            shall not fight with technology to make something, SOLID was brought to us
            by these who value our time and pity our eyes, write comments especially
            about tricky things, be simple for at the end the sole task for a developer
            is to turn complex to simple.
        </p>

        I spend at computer around a lot of  time a daily, that means that
        I shall enjoy what I’m doing, so what do I enjoy? I like to make things
        working, take a concept and bring it to life. Like to keep it damn simple.
        So far my life  mostly evolves around web applications. I did full stack
        development.
