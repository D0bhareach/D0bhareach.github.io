I have layed my hands on the\n            keyboard something around 1988. Since then I have wrote code on such\n            programming languages as: PHP, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript,\n            Dart, Python, Golang, Rust and a little bit of C. And of course use HTML\n            and CSS for a web development. I have enjoyed developing web, desktop,\n            CLI and mobile applications, some of these I enjoy developing more than others.\n        </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text__paragraph\">\n            Why have I try so many things?\n            Out of curiosity and presence of time, I guess. Once man tested things he\n            will find his preferences and I have found mines. By my opinion programmer\n            shall not fight with technology to make something, SOLID was brought to us\n            by these who value our time and pity our eyes, write comments especially\n            about tricky things, be simple for at the end the sole task for a developer\n            is to turn complex to simple.\n        </p>\n    <p className=\"text__paragraph\">\n        I spend at computer around a lot of  time a daily, that means that\n        I shall enjoy what I’m doing, so what do I enjoy? I like to make things\n        working, take a concept and bring it to life. Like to keep it damn simple.\n        So far my life  mostly evolves around web applications. I did full stack\n        development.\n        </p>\n    </section>\n    </>);\n}\n\n","import './about.scss';\nimport AboutInfo from './text/About';\n\nexport default function ThirdComponent(){\n    return (\n        <div className=\"main-content-holder\">\n        <AboutInfo />\n        </div>\n    );\n\n}\n"],"names":["AboutInfo","className","ThirdComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
